                <p>The ancient practices of mindfulness and meditation have gained more worldwide appeal over the last few years. These practices fundamentally promote a healthy lifestyle and provide countless benefits. Mindfulness is the approach through which one maintains a positive, open-minded and attentive focus on each aspect of day-to-day life. On the other hand, meditation comes in many forms, but one common method consists of clearing the mind and concentrating on the present moment by focusing on one's breath.</p>

                <p>How To Meditate</p>
                
                <div id="subtext">
                    <p>There are many ways to meditate, however, one common approach is to focus on your breath. Simply find a comfortable sitting position, close your eyes and breathe naturally. You can think of an object or mantra, or simply focus on your body's rhythmic breathing. Try not to get attached to thoughts that may come and go and anytime you find yourself getting distracted, keep bringing your focus back to your breathing. Start meditating for short periods of 2-5 minutes and gradually work your way up to 15-20 minutes a day as you continue to practice!</p>
